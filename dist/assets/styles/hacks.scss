/**
This file contains CSS hacks which solve problems in a not very clean way.

Keep the dirty things in this file to improve maintanability, so that over the
time hacks can be replaced by cleaner and more clever solutions. For example
some library could be updated or some old browser support dropped, making some
hacks no more necessary.

Important: explain carefully the problem and possibly add external references/links.
